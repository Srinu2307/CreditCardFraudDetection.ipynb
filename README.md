As the use of credit cards for transactions has increased over the years, so has the risk of fraudulent activities. To mitigate these risks, various sophisticated techniques and machine learning models have been developed to detect and prevent credit card fraud Credit Card Fraud Detection: My model incorporates various techniques, including Random Forest, data augmentation to address highly unbalanced data, anomaly detection, and Logistic Regression. Initially, the accuracy stood at 70%; however, it significantly increased to an impressive 95% after the implementation of Random Forest. The data set was huge but you can get it from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
